# TDD-Katas

This project will grow into a collection of Test Driven Development 'Drills', simple step-by-step practice exercises to 
train the habit of [Red-Green Refactoring](http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Red-Green-Refactor.html).

[Kata](http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/2012/05/02/kata-the-only-way-to-learn-tdd/) is a Japanese word associated with 
martial arts which lends itself to:
> a choreographed pattern of movements used to train yourself to the level of muscle memory

Similar to the way a musician might warm-up with scales or a sports person might run drills - to reach the highest levels
of proficiency, consistent practice of the structured basics is key.

These exercises take away the logic and thought. The problem has already been solved, the tests written and code cleanly refactored. 
Each project will have a history or step by step commmits, detailing how the contents of the project made its way its current form.
The task for each of these Katas is to replicate every step of development, exercising the discipline to only proceed one step at a 
time even though the path may be obvious. 

Practice the habit of **writing a failing test**, **_THEN_** writing only enough **code to pass** the test, **_THEN_** **cleaning up** 
the code while still passing the test, **_AND REPEAT_**.
